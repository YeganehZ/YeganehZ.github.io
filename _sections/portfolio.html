<p>Hi! I'm Yeganeh, a dedicated Machine Learning researcher driven by the mission to unravel 
  the mysteries of intelligent systems. Armed with a solid background in Electrical Engineering, I specialize in the 
  intricate domain of designing autonomous artificial intelligence. My expertise lies in exploring and implementing 
  cutting-edge techniques in machine learning, allowing me to craft innovative solutions to real-world challenges. 
  I am deeply fascinated by the limitless potential of machine learning, and my work reflects a relentless pursuit 
  of novel ideas that can shape the future of technology.</p>

<p>I invite you to explore my research through coding, where I have shared a collection of meticulously crafted MATLAB and Python codes. 
  These repositories reflect my passion for programming, problem-solving, and data analysis. </p>

  In the MATLAB section, you'll find:

    -[Repository Name 1]: [Brief Description]
    -[Repository Name 2]: [Brief Description]
    -[Repository Name 3]: [Brief Description]

  My MATLAB projects showcase my proficiency in numerical computing, simulations, signal processing, 
  adaptive estimation, and machine learning. These projects reflect the coding experience that I have 
  acquired throughout my academic career. 

  In the Python section, you'll discover:

   -[Repository Name 1]: [Brief Description]
   -[Repository Name 2]: [Brief Description]
   -[Repository Name 3]: [Brief Description]

  These Python codes demonstrate my experience in data manipulation, machine learning, and algorithms 
implementation that I have gained from taking Online courses over the years. Feel free to explore the code, 
offer feedback, or collaborate on exciting new ideas.
