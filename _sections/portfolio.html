<p>Hi! I'm Yeganeh, a dedicated Machine Learning researcher driven by the mission to unravel 
  the mysteries of intelligent systems. Armed with a solid background in Electrical Engineering, I specialize in the 
  intricate domain of designing autonomous artificial intelligence. My expertise lies in exploring and implementing 
  cutting-edge techniques in machine learning, allowing me to craft innovative solutions to real-world challenges. 
  I am deeply fascinated by the limitless potential of machine learning, and my work reflects a relentless pursuit 
  of novel ideas that can shape the future of technology.</p>

<p>I invite you to explore my research through coding, where I have shared a collection of meticulously crafted MATLAB and Python codes. 
  These repositories reflect my passion for programming, problem-solving, and data analysis. </p>

<p>In the MATLAB section, you'll find:</p>

    <h2>-[Repository Name 1]: [Brief Description]</h2>
    <h2>-[Repository Name 2]: [Brief Description]</h2>
    <h2>-[Repository Name 3]: [Brief Description]</h2>


  <p> My MATLAB projects showcase my proficiency in numerical computing, simulations, signal processing, 
      adaptive estimation, and machine learning. These projects reflect the coding experience that I have 
      acquired throughout my academic career.</p> 

  <p>In the Python section, you'll discover:</p>

    <h2>-[Repository Name 1]: [Brief Description]</h2>
    <h2>-[Repository Name 2]: [Brief Description]</h2>
    <h2>-[Repository Name 3]: [Brief Description]</h2>

  <p>These Python codes demonstrate my experience in data manipulation, machine learning, and algorithms 
     implementation that I have gained from taking Online courses over the years. Feel free to explore the code, 
     offer feedback, or collaborate on exciting new ideas.</p>
