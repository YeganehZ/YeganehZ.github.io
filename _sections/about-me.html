<p>Welcome to my GitHub page. I am Yeganeh, a dedicated Machine Learning researcher driven by the mission to unravel 
  the mysteries of intelligent systems. Armed with a solid background in Electrical Engineering, I specialize in the 
  intricate domain of designing autonomous artificial intelligence. These advanced systems operate independently, adapt to changing conditions, 
  learn from new data, and make decisions based on experience. My expertise lies in exploring and implementing cutting-edge techniques in machine learning, allowing me to craft innovative 
  solutions to real-world challenges. I am deeply fascinated by the limitless potential of machine learning, 
  and my work reflects a relentless pursuit of novel ideas that can shape the future of technology.</p>
